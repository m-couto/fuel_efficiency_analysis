# Car's fuel efficiency analysis

In this project we analyzed the influence of the type of transmission (automatic or manual) on the number of miles per galon.

We started by exploring the data and conjecturing some hypothesis. Then, we performed some linear regression models and hypothesis tests, and our model seems to predict the conclusion that manual cars have higher fuel efficiency than automatic cars. All this is illustrated by several plots.

This project's code is written in `project_code.R` and the report can be found in `report.Rmd` and `report.pdf`.

This project was developed during the Regression Models course of the Data Science specialization.
